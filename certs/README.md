Certificates and keys
=====================

Since this is only for testing, we've choosen to publish all
certificates and keys so you can set up tests too, maybe
enhance them and feed your ideas back to us.

Normally, your private key should never ever be distributed
outside your control. Do not send in email, do not store
in a directory that everyone has access too. The private
key is actually the key to your secure server. Keep it
private.

Summary: Don't do this at home, folks.
